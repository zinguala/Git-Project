THIS IS A PYTHON SCRIPT THAT AUTOMATES THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZING FILES IN A
DIRECTORY BASED ON THEIR FILE TYPES AUDIO,IMAGE,DOCUMENT,SCRIPT,VIDEO:
1. SCANS A SPECIFIED DIRECTORY FOR FILES. WHICH WE ENTER AS INPUT
2. DETERMINES THE TYPE OF EACH FILE (E.G., IMAGE, VIDEO, DOCUMENT).
3. CREATES NEW FOLDERS FOR EACH FILE TYPE IF THEY DON'T ALREADY EXIST.
4. MOVES EACH FILE TO ITS CORRESPONDING FOLDER.
